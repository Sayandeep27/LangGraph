A non-agentic AI would follow the instructions exactly, but an agentic AI would be able to understand the context, make decisions, and take actions that are not explicitly programmed.\\n\\nFor example, if the robot sees that the room is messy and there's a lot of dust, an agentic AI might decide to use a vacuum cleaner instead of a broom, or even suggest cleaning the room in a different way. It's like the AI is taking initiative and acting like a human agent would.\\n\\nAgentic AI is still a developing area of research, but it has the potential to revolutionize many areas, such as:\\n\\n- Robotics: Agentic AI could enable robots to perform complex tasks and adapt to new situations.\\n- Healthcare: Agentic AI could help doctors and nurses make decisions and take actions that are tailored to individual patients.\\n- Finance: Agentic AI could help investors and traders make decisions based on complex data and market trends.\\n\\nHowever, agentic AI also raises concerns about accountability, safety, and ethics, as it could potentially make decisions that are not in the best interest of humans.\""
